# Universal-Downloader
Version 1.0.0 (RELEASE)

# Purpose
Yes you can just download the file from the link although why do that when you can download it through the safer Universal Downloader.
Also don't you want to contribute to Open Source? Well then why don't you add a timer into my script or maybe even a reminder module!

# Installation and usage
1. Head to the "releases" link in the mid right of screen
2. Click or download the .rar file named "UniDownloader"
3. Now click on the newly downloaded file at the bottom of your browser (If your on Chrome)
4. Drag the folder inside the downloaded file and drop it on your desktop
5. Double click the Python file and type "install" (config command will open a important menu)
6. Enter the directory path to where you want the download to occur
7. Rename the file to what you wish
8. Enter the download URL
If you have any questions dont hesitate at all to make a issue in github
